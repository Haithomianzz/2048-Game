2048 is a single player sliding tile puzzle video game. The objective of the 
game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile 
with the number 2048. It is played on a plain 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles 
that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys (Left Arrow 
Key to Move Left, Right Arrow Key to Move Right, Up Arrow Key to Move Upward, 
Down Arrow Key to Move Downward). Every turn, a new tile randomly 
appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles 
slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by 
either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number 
collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the 
two tiles that collided.
